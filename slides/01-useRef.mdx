# useRef

<Spacer />

useRef is a really underestimated hook that provides you a way to create a mutable object that persists between renders.
That way you can keep values around to use for internal purposes on your components and hooks. Its similar to `useState` in the fact
that it holds some sort of state for the component. 

<Spacer />

<img src={useRefTweet} />

<Spacer />


```js

const ref = useRef("üêç");

ref.current === üêç" // true

```

<Spacer />

This will create a object that has a `current` property on it, and thats where you can store
whatever values you want. The API is pretty simple, the value you pass into the hook will be set as the internal value,
note this value passed in will only be set in the first render.

---

Mutating the useRef object will not trigger a rerender and thats its gratest feature. The example below shows the
implementation of a counter using useRef. Note that this will not work like useState does.

<Spacer />

```js

function CounterRef() {
  const countRef = React.useRef(0);
  const rerender = useRerender();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{countRef.current}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => countRef.current--}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => countRef.current++}>+</button>
      <button onClick={rerender}>Rerender</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

<CounterRef/>

---

Ok, and now you might be wondering why would you need useRef? Can't you just have a variable outside your component
that you can use? Well you could, but it would not work as you would expect.

```js

let counter = 0;

export function CounterLet() {
  const rerender = useRerender();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{counter}</h1>
      <Button onClick={() => counter--}>-</Button>
      <Button onClick={() => counter++}>+</Button>
      <Button onClick={rerender}>Rerender</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

<CounterLet/>

<Spacer />

üëâüèº In the next slide we will see the issue with this approach.

## The issue with module level variables.

<Spacer />

Play around with these examples, two examples of the same component

<Spacer />

```js

// let counter = ...
<CounterLet/>
<CounterLet/>

```

<CounterLet/>
<CounterLet/>

<Spacer />

You can quickly see the issue here. In this case they are sharing the same the counter variable.

So now we can see how important useRef is to give use persistency and isolation in our components.

<!-- section-title: Accessing the DOM with useRef -->
# Accessing DOM

<Spacer />

The most common use case you will see for useRef is for accessing te undelying DOM element
that is behind the JSX we write. That way we can interact directly with the DOM element if needed.

<Spacer />

Note that you should only manipulate the element inside the ref after render. Since the DOM element has not been
created yet, before the render occurs.

<Spacer />

```js

export function AccessDOM() {
  const domRef = React.useRef(null);
  const [hide, setHide] = React.useState(false);
  const [el, setEl] = React.useState(domRef.current);

  const toggle = () => setHide((h) => !h);

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    setEl(domRef.current &&  domRef.current.nodeName )
  }, [hide]);

  return (
    <div>
      {!hide && <div ref={domRef}>Hello üëã</div>}
      <span >{el ? `Node name is a ${el}` : `Node is ${el}`}</span>
      <Button onClick={toggle}>Toggle Hide</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

<Spacer />

<AccessDOM />

<!-- section-title: useRef and dependency arrays -->
# useRef and dependency array

<Spacer />

You can use the useRef hook as a bail out for passing something into the dependency array
that you know will be different every render. You want to have the latest value of the unstable value,
but not invalidate the dependency array just because of it.

<Spacer />

In this case below you will have this useEffect run on every render
just because the inline callback is a new one on every render. If you only omit from the
dependency array and break the rules of hooks you might end up with a stale function inside the useEffect,
that point to stale variables from previous renders.

```js

const useHook(aInlineCallback) {
  // more stuff here
  React.useEffect(() => {
    aInlineCallback(other, stable, deps)
  }, [other, stable, deps, aInlineCallback])
  // more stuff here
}
// hook usage
useHook(() => (...))

```

---

## How to bail out of dependency array.

<Spacer />

In this case below you will have the useEffect run only when the stable values on the dependency array changes,
but you still get the benefits of having the most up to date funtion. 

<Spacer />

NOTE: if you want you effect to run when
the function changes you should tell the user to pass the function wrapped in useCallback.

<Spacer />

```js

const useHook(aInlineCallback) {
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(aInlineCallback);

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    callbackRef.current = aInlineCallback
  });
  // more stuff here
  React.useEffect(() => {
    callbackRef.current(other, stable, deps)
  }, [other, stable, deps]);
  // more stuff here
}
// hook usage
useHook(() => (...));

```
